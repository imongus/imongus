# ey yo! ðŸ©¸

welcome to my spot on github! im mongus, a newbie coder who's just dipping my toes into the coding universe. ðŸ’€

## about me

im **low key sus**, sneaking around and trying to figure out this whole coding thing. but hey we all gotta start somewhere right?

## my interests

  **coding**: im on a mission to level up my coding skills and become **less sus** with every line of code i write. trying to hack the code like im hacking the mainframe, ya know?
  **gaming**: when im not coding you'll find me venting into the gaming world, exploring **sus** territories and completing tasks. hunting down impostors like a pro detective.
  **community**: im all about connecting with other **sus** beginners sharing tips and tricks, and maybe even forming a crew. forming an elite squad of sus coders, ready to take on any challenge.

## let's connect!

if you're also on this sus journey of learning to code or have some sussy beginner-friendly projects let's link up and make some magic happen! slide into my DMs with your best impostor strats ðŸ”«

**thanks for stopping by! stay sussy! ðŸ”ªðŸ©¸**
